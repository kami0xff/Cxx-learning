//c++ is strongly type 
//	- all variables must declare all their datatypes before they are used.
//  - Strong typing ensures correct amount of storage is used for our program objects.
//  - ensures that only correct operations can be performed on something's data.
//  - it prevents memory leaks and illegal operations.


//one of the drawbacks of strong typed languages 
//is if we want to perform the same action on many types of variables we have to do some extra work

//in C you could do #define and void* to get around the type system but these don't operate in
//a datatype safe way. 
// 
//we can use overloaded functions for every case that we need but this comes at a maintenance 
//cost for our code making it less flexible and harder to extend and maintain.

//or templates
